Presentations will be hosted here and available after meetups.

## Adding a presentation

If you have given a presentation at the freeCodeCampJxn meetup, you can add it by following the below instructions:

1. Create a new github branch off of the master branch.
2. If a folder for the meetup does not exist, create it and name it in the format of `2019_06_25_meetup`.
3. Add your presentation in preferably pdf format to the folder with a naming convention of `css_sass_less_eliot_sanford`.
4. Submit a [PR](https://github.com/freecodecampjxn/presentations/compare) and ask for [@techieeliot](https://github.com/techieeliot), [@sdhutchins](https://github.com/sdhutchins), or [@Ahstack](https://github.com/ahstack) to review it.
